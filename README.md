# Choice-based Conjoint Analysis - Student accommodation

The analysis is a Choice-based Conjoint Analysis on student accommodation. The study has been conducted during the course "Laboratory of Customer and Business Analytics" (Master's Degree in Data Science - University of Trento).

The analysis has the aim of investigating students' preferences about student accommodation according to five different attributes, which are:

- typology: 'single'; 'shared/double'
- position (distance from the university): '<500m'; '500m - 1.5km'; '>1.5km'
- number of tenants: '2'; '3-4'; '5-6'
- facilities: 'living-room'; 'balcony in the room'; 'dishwasher and microwave'
- prices (in euros): '250'; '350': '450'

The analysis can be found in the '.md' file, and it uses the Bootstrap function, that can be found in the '.R' file.
'block1.csv' and 'block2.csv' are the responses of the choice-based survey.
